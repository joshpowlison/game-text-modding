# The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (GCN)

(this is all for my own reference mostly for now, and I can't guarantee it's all accurate. It's very much experimental. Feel free to make pull requests to fix things)

## Relevant Files

### root > res > Msg > bmgres.arc

This file appears contains all of the textbox text in the game. Most likely other text (like on the main menu) are sprites, not actual text.

## Text Rules

* Text starts down. You'll have to scroll a ways until you start seeing words.

1. Text automatically wraps at XX characters (must determine)
◙ : line breaks, but in sequence it appears to just be used as filler after text (the code probably pulls the text out in blocks of a fixed length)
•(null)(null)• : Makes the text appear immediately
→♣(null)(null) `00011010|00000101|00000000|00000000|00000000`: Player name

## Process

### Getting the file(s)

1. Download and open up [GCRebuilder](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/619/)
2. Open your Wind Waker ISO
3. Find the file *res > Msg > bmgres.arc*
4. Right-click it and click "Export..."
5. Save the file somewhere on your computer. You can rename it to whatever you want.
6. Open the file in [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) (or another hex editor) (tip: set *View > Text Encoding* to *DOS/IBM-ASCII (OEM)*. Also set )
7. Update the text that you want to (use Ctrl+F to find the text you want to replace more easily. Make sure "Search direction" is set to "All"!)
8. Save the file (or "Save As" to keep the original)
9. Return to GCRebuilder and find the file *res > Msg > bmgres.arg* again.
10. Right-click it and click "Import..."
11. Find the new version of the file and select it.

You can now use the ISO and it will have the updated text.
